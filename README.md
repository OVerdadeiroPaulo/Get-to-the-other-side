## Description
"Get to the other side" is a game developed in Haskell as part of the first-year coursework for the LEI course at Uminho. The game is designed to mimic the popular game Crossy Road, in which the player must navigate a character across a busy road to reach the other side.

## How to play
The game is played using the arrow keys on the keyboard to move the character up, down, left, or right. The objective is to reach the other side of the screen without getting hit by any of the moving obstacles, such as cars or trucks. If the player collides with an obstacle, the game is over.

## How to run
To run the game, you will need to have Haskell installed on your computer. Once you have Haskell installed, follow these steps:

Download the game files from the GitHub repository.
Open a terminal window and navigate to the folder containing the game files.
** Run the following command to compile the game: **

```` ghc Main.hs ````

** Run the following command to start the game: **

```` ./Main ````


The game should start running in the terminal window. Use the arrow keys to move the character and try to reach the other side without getting hit.

## Contributors
The game was developed by Paulo Moreira and Silv√©rio Samuel as part of their first-year coursework for the LEI course at Uminho. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free to contact us.
